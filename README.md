# üêç Python Async Programming Sessions

A repository for exploring **asynchronous programming in Python**. This collection of examples demonstrates various concurrency models, ranging from simple synchronous HTTP requests to advanced async patterns using decorators, futures, and more.

## What is Asynchronous Programming?

Asynchronous programming enables you to write non-blocking, concurrent code using constructs like `async/await` and event loops. It is ideal for I/O-bound tasks and improves the performance of network and parallel operations without relying solely on multi-threading or multi-processing.

## Key Imports & Modules

These examples utilize several Python modules, including:

- **Core Async Tools:** `asyncio`
- **HTTP Clients:** `aiohttp`, `requests`
- **Concurrency:** `threading`, `multiprocessing`
- **Utilities:** `time`, `functools`, `os`

## Examples Included

- **Synchronous Requests:**  
  Simple HTTP requests using the `requests` library.

- **Threading & Multiprocessing:**  
  Demonstrations of running tasks concurrently using threads and processes.

- **Asyncio Basics:**  
  Creating async functions, using `asyncio.sleep`, and managing tasks with the event loop.

- **Advanced Async Techniques:**  
  Handling timeouts, cancellation, and using custom decorators (e.g., for timing execution).
